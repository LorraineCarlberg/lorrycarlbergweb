   <p id="about">As a kid I never thought of myself as the artistic type. I had originally wanted to be a doctor, but around 6th grade I changed my mind, as kids do. I changed it twice more before I found myself in the IMM room at Central Tech in Drumright during their sophmore week. I immediately knew I wanted to be in the class although I didnt know what I wanted to do. During the first semester our instructor went over photography and I found myself intrigued. After a couple weeks I was hooked on taking pictures, I even started taking pictures at school events and posting them on my social media. I found a sense of pride when I overheard other students talking about my pictures or when they stopped me to tell me about how much they enjoyed them, some even tried to hire me to take pictures of them. </p>
